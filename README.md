# This project was made with the help of scrimba tutorial

+ I added some features like : 
  - Rolls count, + display
  - Best score saved to local storage, + display
  - Reset best score button.

used 2 new React packages : 
  - Confettis, (To show confettis when won)
  - Nanoid. (To get unique ID)

made my mind clearer on how to update child properties in parent & pass updated properties as props.
